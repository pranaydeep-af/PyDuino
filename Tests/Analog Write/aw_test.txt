The aw function works exactly as the analogWrite() function works. There are two parameters, the pin number and a value between 0 and 255.
A circuit was designed to test the workings of aw. The circuit was used with an Arduino UNO.
An LED is connected to PIN 3 of the Arduino UNO and another to pin 5 with necessary resistors.
The python code is provided as aw_test.py.
