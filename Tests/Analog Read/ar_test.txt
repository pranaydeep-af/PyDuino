The ar function works as the analogRead function does. It takes one argument which is the pin no between 0 and 5.
It returns an output between 0 for ground and 1023 for 5V.
A circuit was designed to test the workings of ar. An Arduino Uno was used to test the function
Circuit Description: A 10k Potentiometer is attached with it's central connection to Pin A0 of Arduino and one to 5V and one to ground. An LED is also attached at pin 3.
The circuit works in a simple way. More the resistance less is the Voltage at A0 and lesser is the brightness of the LED at pin 3.
The python code for the above is provided as ar_test.py.
